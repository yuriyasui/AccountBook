# Account book

I would like to create an application that would allow me to set multiple goals amount and
tell me how much money I have saved and how many dollars I have left to reach my goal amount.
This app is targeted at people who are managing their money and also
want to save money.
I am currently having a hard time keeping track of my money and would like to be able to
create an app that allows me to easily manage my money in and out.


- As a user, I want to set a goal amount (with the purposes).
- As a user, I want to be able to add the amount of money I earned.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how much I have saved now.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how much more money I need to save to achieve the goals.
- As a user, I want to be able to see my targeted goals.

- As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save
my target money list to file and have the option to do so or not.
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my goal list from file.


# Instructions for Grader
- Adding multiple goals to an Account by "setting a goal" button
- Removing goals when the target amount of money is achieved by "adding money"
- You can locate my visual component by seeing below the main menu display
- You can save the state of my application by "save to file" button
- You can reload the state of my application by "load from file" button

#Phase 4: Task 2

Fri Dec 01 15:46:13 PST 2023
Added money $: 100.0
Fri Dec 01 15:46:13 PST 2023
Achieved a goal: Shoes


#Phase 4: Task 3
I can use hashmap which stores Goals and the amount of money each goal want to save instead of list of Goals.
Because, it is going to be easier to change the goal value whenever I want to change and more organized.
